# Travel-Planner

## Overview

I created an app that will allow users to keep track of their activities as they are planning their next adventure. Users can enter the date, price, and description of their activity. They are also able to edit and delete these activities and add new trips to their list. It enables users to keep an organized list of activities so as to not get overwhelmed when planning a trip.
